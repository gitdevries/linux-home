# Linux Home (WIP)
Base configuration and apps I most likely use on servers or desktop

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Move all repositroy files into your home folder
3. `chmod +x install.sh`
4. Run the installation script

### Base Installation
This is the bast I use on all linux based setups. Think of terminal, aliases etc.

### Zorin Installation
Is the alternative to Windows and macOS designed to make your computer faster, more powerful, secure, and privacy-respecting. Therefore I have to setup some basic apps I often use on my Laptops or Desktops. 

**Includes**
- PHPStorm
- Github Desktop
